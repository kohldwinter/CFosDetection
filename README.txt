# Automated software for C-Fos immunoreactive cell detection

This project builds an interactive interface where users can load images for quantification, manually define up to 4 regions of interest (ROI), and quantify neuron expression within each ROI. It then exports cell counts for each ROI for each image. 

## Features
- ROI definition
- Automated cell quantification
- Data parsing & organization
- GUI for visual control

## Tech Stack
Python, tkinter, numpy, matplotlib
